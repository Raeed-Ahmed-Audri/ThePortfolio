						<h4>My name is Raeed Ahmed Audri</h4>
						
						<div class ="mainpara" >
							<p>In my view, an engineer embodies the essence of persistent resilience in the face of failure. These individuals or groups are made up of a series of setbacks, constantly experiencing failure in various tasks, projects, or calculations, yet never ceasing in their efforts. Engineers are distinguished by their unwavering perseverance, adaptability, and determination, regardless of the challenges they encounter.

							As I navigate my own journey in engineering, I acknowledge that I may falter; I may receive a low grade on a test, feel lost during work, or accidentally damage several capacitors. However, I will never stop trying, pursuing curiosity, working diligently, and learning from my mistakes until I ultimately achieve success. I humbly ask those reading this to grant me the opportunity to transform your company's setbacks into triumphs and, in the process, help me embody my definition of an engineer.

					    <a href="pic/portfolio/fullpic1.png" data-fancybox="portfolio" data-caption="I designed and developed a versatile stopwatch and timer system using the popular AVR atmega328p microcontroller and the C programming language. The core of the system is built around a custom-designed circuit that integrates a stepper motor, an LED display, and control buttons for reset, start, stop, and mode selection. Additionally, a joystick controller is incorporated for manual reset of the clock hand, adding more flexibility to the user interface.

							One of the key features of this project is the utilization of the microcontroller's on-board ADC module to read and convert analog input signals into digital values. These values are then used in the program to control the stepper motor and LED display, ensuring seamless integration of components.

							To guarantee consistent execution of code and accurate timing, I implemented real-time paced loops. This was achieved by using the microcontroller's timer/counter module and an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to trigger the loop at regular intervals. This technique helps maintain precise control over the stepper motor and the LED display, resulting in accurate and reliable timekeeping.

							Moreover, I utilized interrupts to handle input events and perform periodic tasks, such as updating the timer or stopwatch. This was accomplished by attaching custom ISRs to the microcontroller's external interrupt pins and timer/counter compare match registers, thereby ensuring responsiveness and efficiency in operation.

							For the stopwatch function, I wrote code using while loops and interrupts. By utilizing the microcontroller's timer/counter module, I incremented a counter variable at regular intervals. Additionally, I employed ISRs to handle stop and reset events, ensuring smooth and accurate performance.

							The timer function relies on accurate timing, which is achieved using real-time paced loops and interrupts. By implementing a countdown feature, I employed a counter variable and ISRs to handle start and stop events, ensuring precise control and reliable operation of the timer.

							In conclusion, this project showcases a successful and reliable stopwatch and timer system developed using the AVR atmega328p microcontroller, stepper motor, LED display, and various control components. " data-filter = "embedded">

					    <a href="pic/portfolio/audioamplifier.jpg" data-fancybox="portfolio" data-caption="A dual rail ±10V regulated DC power supply is built by first using a center-tapped transformer to convert the input AC voltage to the required voltage level. The transformer provides isolation and voltage scaling. The rectifier, typically a full-wave bridge rectifier, converts the AC voltage to a pulsating DC voltage. A filter, often a capacitor, smooths the pulsating DC voltage, reducing voltage ripples. The zener shunt regulator uses zener diodes to maintain a constant output voltage across the rails, ensuring stable power for the audio band amplifier. The power supply is capable of delivering 25mA from each rail simultaneously to meet the amplifier's requirements. The audio band amplifier uses a combination of common emitter, common base, and common collector BJT amplifiers to achieve the desired voltage gain, input impedance, and output voltage swing. The design frequency of 2kHz is set using appropriate component values, such as resistors and capacitors. The input impedance greater than 10kΩ is achieved by utilizing a high input impedance stage like the common base or common collector configuration. The minimum 10V peak-to-peak output voltage swing is attained through careful selection of biasing and transistor parameters, ensuring the amplifier operates within its linear region.">

					    <a href="pic/portfolio/singlephasetothreephase.jpg" data-fancybox="portfolio" data-caption="I designed and built a single-phase to three-phase converter that transforms a single-phase input power source into a three-phase output, primarily used for powering three-phase motors and other equipment. This converter is essential for operating three-phase equipment in areas where only single-phase power is available. The converter I built uses a combination of power electronic components, such as rectifiers and inverters, along with control circuitry. To build the converter, I first developed a schematic that outlined the necessary components and connections. The conversion process in my design involves rectifying the single-phase AC input into DC voltage using a full-wave rectifier, typically constructed with diodes. This rectifier ensures efficient conversion of the input power while minimizing losses. After rectification, the DC voltage is filtered with a capacitor to minimize voltage ripples and provide a stable power source for the inverter stage. The capacitor value was carefully selected to achieve an optimal balance between size and filtering performance. The next step was to design and implement an inverter, often consisting of IGBTs or MOSFETs, which is responsible for converting the smoothed DC voltage into a three-phase AC output. I selected the appropriate switching devices based on factors such as voltage and current ratings, as well as switching frequency requirements. To control the inverter and generate the desired three-phase output, I utilized a microcontroller or a dedicated driver circuit. This control circuitry ensures proper sequencing and timing of the inverter switches, resulting in a balanced three-phase output with the correct phase displacement. I programmed the microcontroller with a suitable control algorithm, which can be adjusted to meet the specific requirements of different applications.">

They are available in configurations such as 1U, 2U, 3U, and more, allowing various payloads and capabilities to be incorporated.

						Using CADaltium, I designed a CubeSat for AlbertaSat to meet specific mission requirements. CADaltium facilitated the development of a precise 3D model, including all subsystems like power, communication, attitude control, and payload. By utilizing CADaltium's capabilities, I was able to ensure the CubeSat adhered to the standard size and mass constraints while maximizing the functionality and performance of the satellite. The modular design of the CubeSat allows for cost-effective and efficient deployment, enabling rapid access to space for research and technology development. The CubeSat designed in CADaltium represents a cutting-edge solution for space exploration, paving the way for future advancements in satellite technology.">

The code first creates a new Simulink model named 'MicrogridModel' and loads the required libraries (Simscape and Simulink). Then, it adds a constant power source block for the solar panel and battery, representing their power outputs. A control system block using a MATLAB Function is also added, which will house the user-defined control algorithms for managing the microgrid.

						Connections are made between the solar panel, battery, and control system, allowing power flow and control signals to be exchanged. The model is then simulated, saved, and closed.

						This code sets up the basic structure of the microgrid model in Simulink, but the control algorithm implementation within the MATLAB Function block must be done manually in Simulink. For more complex models, using Simulink's graphical interface is recommended to design and interconnect components. However, MATLAB code can still be used for parameter manipulation, simulation, and result analysis. This example serves as a starting point for developing more advanced microgrid models with fault-tolerant control systems, enabling efficient and resilient power sharing among distributed energy resources.">
